        <p>The Ohio State University (commonly Ohio State or OSU) is a public research university in <a href="https://www.columbus.gov/">Columbus, Ohio</a>. Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and the ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862,[5] the university was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The college originally focused on various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but it developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of then-Governor (later, U.S. president) Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to "The Ohio State University".[6] The main campus in Columbus, Ohio, has since grown into the third-largest university campus in the United States.[7]</p>
